# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to help Steve analyize stock data. Steve wanted help finding the total daily volume and yearly return for differnt stocks. The daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day. The yearly return is the percentage differnce in price from the begining of the year to the end of the year. In order to help Steve, we desgined a workbook in Excel to easily Steve with daily volume and yearly return for each stock.
## Results
We were asked to show the performance of 11 stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018. We wanted to show the ticker, total daily volume, and return for each of those years and these were the results.
#### 2017:

The results show that in 2017, the return on all but one stock were in the postive. We made this easy to see by highlighting the stocks with a positive return with the color green and the stocks with a negative return, with the color red. As for 2018, we only saw a positive return on two stocks. 
We also wanted to know how long it took to run the code for each year.

## Summary
The advantages of refactoring code are:
* It can help imporve the code to run faster.
* It can help find bugs.
* it can help make the code easier to understand.

The disadvantages of recatoring code are:
* It can become diffucult the the code is big.
* It can be hard to do if the code isn't already understood.
* Refactoring could produce more bugs.

The advantage of the refactored VBA script is that it helped the code run faster than the original script. With this being said, the original script still worked fine.
